1
00:01:57,994 --> 00:02:02,123
Our pasta this evening is 
squid ravioli in a lemongrass broth

2
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:05,794
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

3
00:02:05,877 --> 00:02:09,297
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade

4
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,716
rare-roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis

5
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,842
with a sorrel timbale...

6
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:16,179
And grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed French fries.

7
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:19,849
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemongrass broth,

8
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,227
and the fish tonight is grilled...

9
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,813
With a double espresso.

10
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,981
God, I hate this place.
It's a chicks' restaurant.

11
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:28,858
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

12
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,945
Because Bateman
won't give the maitre d' head.

13
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:35,907
Is that Reed Robinson over there?

14
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,867
Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.

15
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,328
- Well, who is it, then?
- It's Paul Allen.

16
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,540
That's not Paul Allen.
Paul Allen's on the other side of the room.

17
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:44,999
- Over there.
- Who's he with?

18
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:46,668
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

19
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,670
They don't have
a good bathroom to do coke in.

20
00:02:48,753 --> 00:02:50,004
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?

21
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,464
Yes, McDufus, I am.

22
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,924
He's handling the Fisher account.

23
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,510
- Lucky bastard.
- Lucky Jew bastard.

24
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,971
Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?

25
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,931
I've seen that bastard sitting in his office,

26
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,767
talking on the phone to the CEO,
spinning a fucking menorah.

27
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:05,311
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

28
00:03:05,395 --> 00:03:06,646
Oh, my God, Bateman.

29
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:10,358
You want me to fry you up some fucking
potato pancakes? Some latkes?

30
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:14,237
No, just cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

31
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,491
Oh, I'd forgotten.
Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.

32
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:21,619
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

33
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,621
Speaking of reasonable.

34
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:24,998
Only $570.

35
00:03:25,957 --> 00:03:27,667
Not bad.

36
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,502
A little something for the purse.

37
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,004
Give her the $50.

38
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,795
Two Stolis on the rocks.

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,049
These aren't good any more. It's a cash bar.

40
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,927
That'll be $25.

41
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:24,349
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

42
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,643
I want to stab you to death,

43
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:29,228
then play around with your blood.

44
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,325
What can I get for you two?

45
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,685
<i>I live in the American Gardens building</i>

46
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,521
<i>on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.</i>

47
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:16,901
<i>My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.</i>

48
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,655
<i>I believe in taking care of myself</i>

49
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:21,990
<i>and a balanced diet</i>

50
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:25,284
<i>and a rigorous exercise routine.</i>

51
00:05:25,368 --> 00:05:27,745
<i>In the morning, if my face is a little puffy,</i>

52
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,040
<i>I'll put on an ice pack while
doing my stomach crunches.</i>

53
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,501
<i>I can do 1,000 now.</i>

54
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:54,313
<i>After I remove the ice pack,
I use</i> a <i>deep-pore cleanser lotion</i>

55
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,859
<i>In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser,</i>

56
00:05:59,944 --> 00:06:02,822
<i>then a honey-almond body scrub,</i>

57
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,868
<i>and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.</i>

58
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,087
<i>Then I apply an herb mint facial mask,</i>

59
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,131
<i>which I leave on for 10 minutes,</i>

60
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,967
<i>while I prepare the rest of my routine.</i>

61
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:27,055
<i>I always use an aftershave lotion</i>

62
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:28,973
<i>with little or no alcohol,</i>

63
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,059
<i>because alcohol dries your face out</i>

64
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:32,977
<i>and makes you look older.</i>

65
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,896
<i>Then moisturiser,</i>

66
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,856
<i>then an anti-ageing eye balm</i>

67
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,318
<i>followed by a final
moisturising protective lotion.</i>

68
00:06:41,694 --> 00:06:45,073
<i>There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,</i>

69
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,116
<i>some kind of abstraction,</i>

70
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,243
<i>but there is no real me,</i>

71
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:52,538
<i>only an entity, something illusory.</i>

72
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:54,957
<i>And though I can hide my cold gaze</i>

73
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,086
<i>and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours,</i>

74
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,754
<i>and maybe you can even sense</i>

75
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,590
<i>our lifestyles are probably comparable,</i>

76
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:06,385
<i>I simply am not there.</i>

77
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,873
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

78
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,297
- Late.
- Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?

79
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,799
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.

80
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,968
He didn't say what
he was cancelling or why.

81
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:50,721
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

82
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,099
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Flutie's Pier 17.

83
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,684
- When?
- After 6.00.

84
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:57,311
- Negative. Cancel it.
- And what should I say?

85
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,815
- Just say no.
- Just say no?

86
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:06,154
Okay, Jean, I need reservations
for three at Camels at 12:30,

87
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:07,905
and if not there, try Crayons, all right?

88
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,949
Yes, sir.

89
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,827
Oh, wait, and I need reservations for two

90
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,997
at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

91
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,166
Something romantic?

92
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:19,584
No.

93
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,587
Silly.

94
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,130
Forget it, I'll make them.

95
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,882
- No, I'll do it.
- No, no.

96
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:29,260
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?

97
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,220
You look nice today.

98
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,847
Don't wear that outfit again.

99
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,348
What? I didn't hear you.

100
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:36,767
I said, do not wear that outfit again.

101
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,103
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.

102
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,147
You don't like this, I take it?

103
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,774
Come on, you're prettier than that.

104
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,902
Thanks, Patrick.

105
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,029
I'm not here.

106
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:51,157
And high heels. I like high heels.

107
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,417
<i>"Feathered Friends" for 600.</i>

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,794
<i>During courtship, the male frigate bird</i>

109
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,589
<i>inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.</i>

110
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,773
Thousands of roses,

111
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:27,235
and lots of chocolate truffles, Godiva,

112
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:28,611
and oysters on the half shell.

113
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,239
<i>I'm trying to listen to the
new Robert Palmer tape,</i>

114
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,407
<i>but Evelyn, my supposed fiancée,</i>

115
00:09:33,491 --> 00:09:36,160
<i>keeps buzzing in my ear.</i>

116
00:09:36,244 --> 00:09:39,247
Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

117
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,250
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

118
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,378
Patrick, we should do it.

119
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,923
- Do what?
- Get married. Have a wedding.

120
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:50,424
No, I can't take the time off work.

121
00:09:50,508 --> 00:09:53,427
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

122
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:54,679
I don't want to talk about it.

123
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:58,140
You hate that job anyway.
I don't see why you just don't quit.

124
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:02,645
Because I want to fit in.

125
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:15,700
Williams party.

126
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,995
<i>I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,</i>

127
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:21,706
<i>since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.</i>

128
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:23,582
<i>But we do,</i>

129
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,502
<i>and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.</i>

130
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,715
Patrick, this is my cousin
Vanden and her boyfriend Stash.

131
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:32,383
They're both artists.

132
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,260
- The menu's in Braille.
- I see you've met everyone.

133
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,262
You look awesome.

134
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:40,391
Okay, okay, all right.

135
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:45,688
<i>I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.</i>

136
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,649
<i>Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.</i>

137
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,443
<i>I'm almost completely indifferent</i>

138
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:53,696
<i>as to whether Evelyn knows
I'm having an affair</i>

139
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,575
<i>with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.</i>

140
00:10:57,658 --> 00:11:00,369
<i>Courtney is almost perfect-looking.</i>

141
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,997
<i>She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.</i>

142
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,374
<i>Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.</i>

143
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:07,335
<i>More disturbing than her drug use, though,</i>

144
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:08,919
<i>is the fact that she's engaged</i>

145
00:11:09,003 --> 00:11:12,465
<i>to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest dufus in the business.</i>

146
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:14,884
Tell me, Stash,

147
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:18,387
do you think Soho
is becoming too commercial?

148
00:11:18,471 --> 00:11:20,014
Yes, I read that.

149
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,474
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

150
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:24,101
Hey, that affects us.

151
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,854
What about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?

152
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,482
Doesn't that affect us, too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?

153
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,443
How, like, the Sikhs are, like,
killing tons of Israelis over there?

154
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,111
Come on, Bryce.

155
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:37,448
There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.

156
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,532
Like what?

157
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:41,160
Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

158
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,746
and slow down the nuclear arms race,

159
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:46,665
stop terrorism, and world hunger.

160
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:50,669
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless

161
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:54,632
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights

162
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,635
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

163
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,970
We have to encourage a return

164
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,599
to traditional moral values.

165
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,559
Most importantly,

166
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:09,688
we have to promote general social concern

167
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,982
and less materialism in young people.

168
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,152
Patrick,

169
00:12:16,487 --> 00:12:18,322
how thought-provoking.

170
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,068
Hello.

171
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,530
Hello.

172
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,468
"Bleach-ee"?
Are you trying to say "bleach-ee"?

173
00:13:20,551 --> 00:13:21,760
Oh, my God. Two things.

174
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:24,805
One, you can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

175
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:27,266
Two, I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

176
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,144
These are very expensive sheets
and I really need them clean.

177
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,271
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,

178
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,564
I will kill you

179
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,984
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison

180
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,528
and I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

181
00:13:39,612 --> 00:13:42,948
I cannot understand you!
This is crazy. You're a fool.

182
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,034
I can't cope with this. Stupid "bitch-ee"!

183
00:13:45,117 --> 00:13:46,827
Understand? Christ.

184
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:48,454
Patrick?

185
00:13:48,746 --> 00:13:51,457
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you

186
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,000
Hello...

187
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,044
Isn't it ridiculous coming
all the way up here?

188
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,545
But they really are the best.

189
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:58,631
Then why can't they get these stains out?

190
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:02,134
Can you talk to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.

191
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:03,969
Oh, what are those?

192
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:07,097
Oh, well, it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple.

193
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:08,224
Really?

194
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,185
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

195
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:14,188
I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

196
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,065
Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

197
00:14:16,148 --> 00:14:19,026
Well, boy, listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

198
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,903
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

199
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,071
You know, I'm downtown...

200
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:25,533
- I don't know. I'm at work all the time.
- What about a Saturday?

201
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,701
- Next Saturday?
- Sure.

202
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,578
Can't, I'm afraid.
I have a matinée of <i>Les Mis.</i>

203
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:32,122
I've really got to go. Christ. I'll call you.

204
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,458
Okay. Do.

205
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,877
Listen, you're dating Luis. He's in Arizona.

206
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:38,879
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

207
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,881
What could you possibly be up to tonight?

208
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:43,384
<i>- Stop it. I'm...
- On a lot of lithium?</i>

209
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,511
Waiting for Luis to call me.

210
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,054
He said he'd call tonight.

211
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,597
Pumpkin.

212
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,849
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.

213
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:54,353
<i>Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.</i>

214
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:58,899
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

215
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:01,735
<i>Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay?</i>

216
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,322
- I have to go.
- Courtney!

217
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:07,866
- Dinner.
- I can't!

218
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,660
<i>I'm thinking Dorsia.</i>

219
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:13,414
Dorsia's nice.

220
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,124
<i>Wear something fabulous.</i>

221
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:30,514
<i>Dorsia.</i>

222
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:31,974
Yes, I know it's a little late,

223
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,602
but is it possible to reserve a table for two

224
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,938
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

225
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,875
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing,

226
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,420
and then to the Pottery Barn

227
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:06,258
where I got this little silver muffin dish.

228
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:07,635
Is that Donald Trump's car?

229
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:09,595
God, Patrick, shut up.

230
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,348
Courtney, you should take
some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

231
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,600
Some caffeine
might get you out of this slump.

232
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:18,312
I just want a child

233
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:20,773
Just two

234
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:22,358
perfect

235
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,736
children.

236
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,450
Are we here?

237
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,910
Yeah.

238
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:41,585
This is Dorsia?

239
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:43,462
- Good evening.
- Yes, dear.

240
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,465
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup

241
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:49,051
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

242
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,844
<i>New York Matinee called it</i>

243
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,930
"a playful, but mysterious little dish."

244
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,431
You'll love it.

245
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,518
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

246
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,478
I think that will follow nicely.

247
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:03,232
Thanks, Patrick.

248
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,366
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

249
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,910
Dorsia, how impressive.

250
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,079
How on earth did you
get a reservation there?

251
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,039
Lucky, I guess.

252
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:21,792
That's a wonderful suit.

253
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,545
Don't tell me, don't tell me, let me guess.

254
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:26,922
Valentino Couture.

255
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:30,718
It looks so soft.

256
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,262
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

257
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:37,558
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.

258
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,059
How the hell are you?

259
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:42,604
<i>Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead,
Marcus Halberstram.</i>

260
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:45,357
<i>It seems logical, because
Marcus also works at P&P</i>

261
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,735
<i>and, in fact, does the same exact thing I do.</i>

262
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,905
<i>He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.</i>

263
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:53,782
<i>Marcus and I even go to the same barber,</i>

264
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,951
<i>although I have a slightly better haircut.</i>

265
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,870
So how's the Ransom account
going, Marcus?

266
00:17:57,953 --> 00:17:59,747
- It's all right.
- Really?

267
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,249
That's interesting. It's not... It's not great.

268
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,003
- Oh, well, you know.
- So how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

269
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,130
Oh, yeah, I'm very lucky.

270
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,049
Hey, Allen.
Congratulations on the Fisher account.

271
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,384
Thank you, Baxter.

272
00:18:12,468 --> 00:18:14,511
Listen, Paul. Squash?

273
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,892
Call me.

274
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:22,853
- How about Friday?
- No can do.

275
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,106
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

276
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,443
Great sea urchin ceviche.

277
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:32,112
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

278
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:33,906
I think he's lying.

279
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:38,076
Is that a gram?

280
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,412
New card.

281
00:18:40,496 --> 00:18:41,538
What do you think?

282
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,292
Whoa. Very nice.

283
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,211
Look at that.

284
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:49,213
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

285
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,465
- Good colouring.
- That's bone.

286
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,301
And the lettering is
something called Silian Rail.

287
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,385
It's very cool, Bateman.

288
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:57,262
But that's nothing. Look at this.

289
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,057
That is really nice.

290
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,684
Eggshell with Romalian type.

291
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,728
What do you think?

292
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,980
Nice.

293
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,399
Jesus. That is really super.

294
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,735
How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

295
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,487
<i>I can't believe</i>

296
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,698
<i>that Bryce prefers Van Patten 's card
to mine.</i>

297
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,952
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

298
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:26,166
Raised lettering. Pale Nimbus White.

299
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,379
Impressive. Very nice.

300
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,550
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

301
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:50,941
<i>Look at that subtle off-white colouring,</i>

302
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,485
<i>the tasteful thickness of it.</i>

303
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,279
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

304
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,489
<i>It even has a watermark.</i>

305
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:04,246
ls something wrong, Patrick?

306
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,331
You're sweating.

307
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,403
Hello.

308
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,823
Pat Bateman. You want some money?

309
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,618
Some food?

310
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:46,413
- This what you need?
- I'm hungry.

311
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,373
Yeah. Cold out, too, isn't it?

312
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,588
Why don't you get a job?

313
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,590
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

314
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:58,759
I lost my job.

315
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,011
Why? You drinking?

316
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,513
Is that why you lost it?

317
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:06,934
Insider trading? Just joking.

318
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,895
- Listen, what's your name?
- Al.

319
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:11,730
Speak up. Come on.

320
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:14,608
- Al.
- Get a goddamn job, Al.

321
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,611
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

322
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,696
You gotta get your act together.

323
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,490
I'll help you.

324
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:23,408
You are so kind, mister.

325
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:25,410
You're kind. You're a kind man.

326
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:26,620
- It's okay.
- I can tell.

327
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,289
Please, you gotta tell me what to do.

328
00:21:29,498 --> 00:21:31,625
You gotta help me. I'm so cold.

329
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,210
I'm hungry.

330
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,630
You know how bad you smell?

331
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:39,216
You reek of shit. Do you know that?

332
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,551
AI.

333
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:44,429
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,724
It's just that... I don't know.

335
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,187
I don't have anything in common with you.

336
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:03,782
Oh, thank you, mister. Thank you.

337
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,742
I'm cold out here.

338
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,745
- You know what a fucking loser you are?
- What?

339
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:35,897
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman.

340
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:38,900
So fine, so smooth.

341
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,244
<i>I have all the characteristics
of a human being,</i>

342
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:53,040
<i>flesh, blood, skin, hair,</i>

343
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:56,334
<i>but not a single clear identifiable emotion,</i>

344
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,838
<i>except for greed and disgust.</i>

345
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,091
<i>Something horrible
is happening inside of me,</i>

346
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,844
<i>and I don't know why.</i>

347
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:09,723
<i>My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.</i>

348
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:13,310
<i>I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.</i>

349
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,813
<i>I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.</i>

350
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,995
Hey, Mac:Loy, what do you say?

351
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,247
Hey, Hamilton,
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

352
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:37,000
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?

353
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,710
Of course. Who else?

354
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,838
Mistletoe alert. Merry Xmas, Patrick.

355
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,591
- Merry Xmas, Harry.
- Merry Christmas.

356
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,259
- You're late, honey.
- I'm not late.

357
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:48,762
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I've been here the entire time.

358
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,222
You just didn't see me.

359
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,473
Say hello to Snowball.

360
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:54,017
Snowball says "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

361
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:55,644
What is it?

362
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:58,271
It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?

363
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,107
It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig.

364
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,984
They make darling pets. Don't you?

365
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,778
Don't you?

366
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:07,989
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.

367
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,283
What does Mr Grinch want for Christmas?

368
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,786
And don't say "breast implants" again.

369
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:18,250
- Allen.
- Marcus! Merry Christmas.

370
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,585
How you been? Workaholic, I suppose?

371
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:22,587
I haven't seen you in a while.

372
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:26,591
Hey, Hamilton! We're going to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

373
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:27,801
We should have dinner.

374
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:29,803
Maybe you could bring...

375
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,305
- Cecilia?
- Yes, Cecilia!

376
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:34,641
Oh, Cecilia would adore it.

377
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,726
Well, then let's do it, Marcus.

378
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,187
- Great party.
- Thanks.

379
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,149
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?

380
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,317
Mistletoe alert.

381
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,412
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7.00.

382
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,456
No, I want to know.

383
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,334
I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo. All right?

384
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,462
Which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

385
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,007
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

386
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,343
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- J&B straight and a Corona.

387
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:13,305
- Would you like to hear...
- Double Absolut martini.

388
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:15,807
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials?

389
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,685
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

390
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,107
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.

391
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,318
This place is hot. Very hot.

392
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:30,405
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.

393
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,948
Yeah, well, you're late.

394
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,577
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.

395
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,830
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-0.

396
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,749
We should've gone to Dorsia.

397
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,417
I could have gotten us a table.

398
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,711
Nobody goes there any more.

399
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,632
Is that lvana Trump?

400
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,551
Oh, jeez, Patrick... I mean, Marcus,

401
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:53,094
what are you thinking?

402
00:25:53,178 --> 00:25:55,931
Why would lvana be at Texarkana?

403
00:25:56,765 --> 00:26:00,602
So, wasn't Rothschild
originally handling the Fisher account?

404
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:02,395
How'd you get it?

405
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,940
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

406
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:07,734
but then I'd have to kill you.

407
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:16,826
I like to dissect girls.

408
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,745
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

409
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:23,792
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.

410
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:25,669
- Where do you tan?
- Salon.

411
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:28,713
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

412
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,592
And Cecilia... How is she?

413
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:33,885
Where is she tonight?

414
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,346
Cecilia is... Well, you know Cecilia.

415
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,933
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.

416
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:42,769
Evelyn! Great ass.

417
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,646
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman.

418
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:47,607
What a dork.

419
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,317
Another martini, Paul?

420
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,866
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

421
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,370
They're okay.

422
00:27:01,246 --> 00:27:05,375
Their early work was
a little too new wave for my taste.

423
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,128
But when Sports came out in '83,

424
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:11,589
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

425
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,095
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound

426
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:19,848
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism

427
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,976
that really gives the songs a big boost.

428
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,821
He's been compared to Elvis Costello,

429
00:27:34,904 --> 00:27:39,451
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humour.

430
00:27:39,534 --> 00:27:41,786
- Hey, Halberstram.
- Yes, Allen?

431
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,332
Why are there copies of the Style section
all over the place?

432
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:46,916
Do you have a dog?

433
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,753
A little chow or something?

434
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,339
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat?

435
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,591
Yes, it is!

436
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,510
In '87, Huey released this,

437
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,637
Forel, their most accomplished album.

438
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:03,058
I think their undisputed masterpiece
is Hip to be Square.

439
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,519
The song's so catchy. Most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

440
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,563
But they should because it's not just about

441
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,399
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends,

442
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,986
it's also a personal statement
about the band itself.

443
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,279
Hey, Paul?

444
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,371
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,

445
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,915
you fucking stupid bastard!

446
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,046
You fucking bastard!

447
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,633
<i>'Cause I can tell
what's going on</i>

448
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,802
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

449
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:41,930
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

450
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:48,395
<i>I like my bands in business suits</i>

451
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:51,773
<i>I watch them on TV</i>

452
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,567
<i>I'm working out 'most every day</i>

453
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,903
<i>And watching what I eat</i>

454
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,574
<i>They tell me that it's good for me</i>

455
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:05,036
<i>But I don't even care</i>

456
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,871
<i>I know that it's crazy</i>

457
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,581
<i>I know that it's nowhere</i>

458
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:10,959
<i>There is no denying that</i>

459
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:13,169
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

460
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,172
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

461
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,273
He was completely naked
and he was standing

462
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:36,025
on one of the tables
with everyone watching...

463
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:39,654
Patrick? Patrick!

464
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,739
Is that you?

465
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,951
No, Luis, it's not me. You're mistaken.

466
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:47,787
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

467
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,248
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.

468
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,667
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

469
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:58,590
Where did you get that overnight bag?

470
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:02,051
Jean Paul Gaultier.

471
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:15,440
<i>When I get to Paul Allen's place,</i>

472
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:19,486
<i>I use the keys I took from his pocket
before disposing of the body.</i>

473
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:22,780
<i>There is a moment of sheer panic</i>

474
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,784
<i>when I realise that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park</i>

475
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:30,288
<i>and it's obviously
more expensive than mine.</i>

476
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,336
<i>I calm myself and move into the bedroom,</i>

477
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,963
<i>where I find his suitcase and start to pack.</i>

478
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:42,759
<i>It's time for Paul to take a little trip.</i>

479
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,180
Where to send the bastard?

480
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:48,973
Dallas?

481
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,851
Paris? Singapore?

482
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,229
London. I'll send the ass to London.

483
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,738
Hi, this is Paul.

484
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,615
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

485
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,742
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.

486
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,494
Hasta la vista, baby.

487
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:35,937
What is it?

488
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:37,647
Patrick.

489
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,358
Yes, Jean?

490
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,527
There's a Mr Donald Kimball
here to see you.

491
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,945
Who?

492
00:31:44,028 --> 00:31:46,155
Detective Donald Kimball.

493
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,328
Tell him I'm at lunch.

494
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,999
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

495
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,835
Send him in, I guess.

496
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,928
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

497
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:12,849
There are definite do's and don'ts, good
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

498
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:15,852
A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-coloured

499
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,313
or discretely patterned suits and ties.

500
00:32:18,396 --> 00:32:21,858
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

501
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:25,194
Listen, John, I've got to go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in

502
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:26,946
Just joking.

503
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,866
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

504
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:33,036
Okay, John. Right. Got it.

505
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:35,788
Sorry about that.

506
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:38,166
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

507
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,293
Was that anything important?

508
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,129
Oh, that?
Just mulling over business problems,

509
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:46,174
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumours,

510
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:48,051
spreading gossip-

511
00:32:49,385 --> 00:32:52,096
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

512
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,807
Hi, Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

513
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:58,436
Sorry to barge in on you like this.
I know how busy you guys can get.

514
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:05,568
So, what's the topic of discussion?

515
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,654
I've been hired by Meredith Powell

516
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:11,282
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

517
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,411
I see, yeah. Paul's disappearance, yeah.

518
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:19,374
So it's nothing that official. I just have
some basic questions about Paul Allen.

519
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:21,000
- About yourself...
- Coffee?

520
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,168
No, I'm okay.

521
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,087
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.

522
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:28,174
- Can you bring Mister...
- Kimball.

523
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:29,509
Mr Kimball a bottle...

524
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,011
- No, really, I'm okay.
- It's no problem.

525
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,683
So, what's the topic of discussion?

526
00:33:36,766 --> 00:33:40,019
The disappearance of Paul Allen.

527
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,270
Right.

528
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:44,357
Well, I haven't...

529
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:48,861
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything,

530
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:51,114
not on <i>Page</i> Six at least.

531
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:54,742
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime?

532
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,912
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure? I can always get you a lime.

533
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:01,708
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay?

534
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:03,126
Shoot

535
00:34:03,543 --> 00:34:06,212
- How old are you?
-27.

536
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,715
- Where did you go to school?
- Harvard.

537
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,259
- Then Harvard Business School.
- Your address?

538
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:13,344
The American Gardens building,
West 81 st Street.

539
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:16,556
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

540
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:20,309
- What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
- I'm at a loss.

541
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,562
He was part of that whole Yale thing.

542
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,148
-"Yale thing"?
- Yeah, Yale thing.

543
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:26,607
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?

544
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:30,445
Well, I think for one that he was
probably a closet homosexual

545
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,780
who did a lot of cocaine.

546
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,365
That Yale thing.

547
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,868
What kind of man was he?

548
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:39,078
Besides the information
you've just given me.

549
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,997
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

550
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,250
- Do you feel like that?
- No, not really.

551
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,588
- Where did Paul hang out?
- Hang out?

552
00:34:48,671 --> 00:34:50,089
Yeah, you know, hang out.

553
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:53,050
Let me think. The Newport.

554
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:55,470
Harry's. Flutie's.

555
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:58,264
Indochine. Nell's. The Cornell Club.

556
00:34:58,347 --> 00:35:00,641
- The New York Yacht Club.
- He had a yacht?

557
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,185
No, he just hung out there.

558
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,312
And where did he go to school?

559
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,484
- Don't you know this?
- I just wanted to know if you know.

560
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:16,324
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
Saint Paul's.

561
00:35:16,407 --> 00:35:19,994
Listen, I just... I just want to help.

562
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,206
I understand.

563
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,126
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

564
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:30,087
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine

565
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,547
that says he went to London.

566
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,883
- Maybe he did, huh?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

567
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:37,136
- But has anyone seen him in London?
- Actually, yes.

568
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,514
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

569
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:43,142
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

570
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,811
But I checked it out, and what happened is

571
00:35:44,894 --> 00:35:47,647
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so...

572
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,357
Had his apartment been burglarized?

573
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,484
No, actually it hadn't.

574
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:54,737
Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone,
so was some luggage, that's it.

575
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,240
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet, or anything, right?

576
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,617
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

577
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,328
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.

578
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:05,248
- So typical, isn't it?
- It's just strange.

579
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:07,500
One day someone's walking around,

580
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:10,294
going to work, alive, and then...

581
00:36:10,378 --> 00:36:11,796
Nothing.

582
00:36:12,797 --> 00:36:14,465
People just disappear.

583
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:18,928
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.

584
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:22,932
Eerie. Really eerie.

585
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:30,773
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

586
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:32,859
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable

587
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:35,069
at The Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

588
00:36:35,653 --> 00:36:38,489
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

589
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,908
I mean, aren't you gonna be late?

590
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:42,702
No, there's one down here.

591
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,954
- Oh, really? I didn't know that.
- It's very good.

592
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,083
Listen, if anything else occurs to you,
any information...

593
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,085
Absolutely. I'm 100% with you.

594
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:56,132
Great, and thanks for your time,
Mr Bateman.

595
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:01,804
- Bye-bye.
- Good bye.

596
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:02,990
I haven't seen you around here.

597
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:04,450
You just haven't been looking.

598
00:38:04,533 --> 00:38:06,160
Would you like to see my apartment?

599
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,038
I'm not supposed to.

600
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:13,209
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?

601
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:18,965
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

602
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,552
Would you take a credit card?

603
00:38:24,387 --> 00:38:27,181
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

604
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,945
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde,

605
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:43,781
who does couples. Couples.

606
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:48,285
And I really can't stress
"blonde" enough. Blonde.

607
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:54,542
I'm Paul. My name's Paul Allen.

608
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,502
You got that?

609
00:38:56,585 --> 00:39:00,464
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

610
00:39:00,548 --> 00:39:01,966
Is that clear?

611
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:15,104
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

612
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,106
I want you to clean your vagina.

613
00:39:25,698 --> 00:39:29,076
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

614
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,997
You have a very nice body.

615
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:46,802
Thank you. Send her up.

616
00:39:49,972 --> 00:39:52,892
Christie, get out and dry off,

617
00:39:52,975 --> 00:39:55,978
choose a robe, not the Bijan,

618
00:39:56,062 --> 00:40:00,483
and come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.

619
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,450
You've arrived! How lovely.

620
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:11,452
Let me take your coat.

621
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,413
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

622
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:21,378
Not quite blonde, are you?

623
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,255
More dirty blonde.

624
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:26,008
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.

625
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:28,094
I'm Paul Allen.

626
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,155
So,

627
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:51,367
don't you want to know what I do?

628
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,873
- No.
- No, not really.

629
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:04,964
Well, I work on Wall Street
at Pierce & Pierce.

630
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,591
Have you heard of it?

631
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:19,395
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

632
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,064
How much did you pay for it?

633
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:26,235
Well, actually,
that's none of your business, Christie.

634
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,822
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

635
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,241
No. No smoking. Not in here.

636
00:41:34,952 --> 00:41:36,328
Varda truffle?

637
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,750
I don't want you to get drunk,

638
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:45,462
but that's a very fine chardonnay
you're not drinking.

639
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,889
Do you like Phil Collins?

640
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,349
I've been a big Genesis fan

641
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:01,520
ever since the release
of their 1980 album, <i>Duke.</i>

642
00:42:02,104 --> 00:42:03,397
Before that,

643
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,525
I really didn't understand any of their work.

644
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:09,987
It was too artsy. Too intellectual.

645
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,698
It was on <i>Duke</i> where

646
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:15,701
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

647
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,497
<i>I think Invisible Touch</i>

648
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:23,500
is the group's undisputed masterpiece.

649
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:29,298
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

650
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:35,346
At the same time, it deepens and enriches

651
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:38,641
the meaning of the preceding three albums.

652
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:41,977
Christie, take off the robe.

653
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:48,984
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

654
00:42:49,652 --> 00:42:53,239
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.

655
00:42:53,656 --> 00:42:56,075
Sabrina, remove your dress.

656
00:42:56,575 --> 00:43:00,579
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

657
00:43:00,663 --> 00:43:03,749
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

658
00:43:03,832 --> 00:43:06,252
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

659
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:10,005
<i>Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion.</i>

660
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:13,259
In this song, Phil Collins
addresses the problems

661
00:43:13,342 --> 00:43:15,761
of abusive political authority.

662
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:22,434
In <i>Too Deep</i> is the most moving
pop song of the 1980s,

663
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:25,437
about monogamy and commitment.

664
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:28,607
The song is extremely uplifting.

665
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:32,778
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative

666
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:36,615
as anything I've heard in rock.

667
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:42,329
Christie, get down on your knees

668
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:45,457
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

669
00:43:45,541 --> 00:43:48,210
Phil Collins' solo career

670
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:50,379
seems to be more commercial,

671
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:54,300
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way.

672
00:43:54,383 --> 00:43:56,885
Especially songs like In The Air Tonight

673
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:59,471
<i>and Against All Odds.</i>

674
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,559
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

675
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,855
But I also think Phil Collins works best

676
00:44:07,938 --> 00:44:11,942
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

677
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:15,237
And I stress the word "artist."

678
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:22,953
This is <i>Sussudio.</i> A great, great song.

679
00:44:23,454 --> 00:44:25,581
A personal favourite.

680
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:37,593
Look at the camera.

681
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:18,092
Christie, look at the camera.

682
00:45:34,316 --> 00:45:36,318
Don't touch the watch.

683
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,175
Can we go now?

684
00:46:00,259 --> 00:46:02,261
We're not through yet.

685
00:46:20,362 --> 00:46:23,949
If they have a good personality and they're
not great-looking, then who fucking cares?

686
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:28,328
Just say, hypothetically, okay,
what if they have a good personality?

687
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:31,248
I know, I know.

688
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,042
There are no girls with good personalities.

689
00:46:34,126 --> 00:46:35,627
A good personality consists of a chick

690
00:46:35,711 --> 00:46:38,797
with a little hard body
who'll satisfy all sexual demands

691
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:40,799
without being too slutty about things

692
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:42,926
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

693
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,512
The only girls with good personalities
who are smart,

694
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,140
or maybe funny or halfway intelligent
or talented,

695
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:51,268
though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.

696
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,352
Absolutely.

697
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,314
And this is because they have to make up
for how fucking unattractive they are.

698
00:46:55,397 --> 00:46:56,982
You know what Ed Gein said
about women?

699
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,650
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

700
00:46:58,734 --> 00:47:01,695
No. Serial killer. Wisconsin, in the '50s.

701
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:02,821
What did Ed say?

702
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:04,448
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,

703
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:08,827
"I think two things. One part of me wants
to take her out and talk to her,

704
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:11,163
"be real nice and sweet and treat her right."

705
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,332
And what did the other part of him think?

706
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:15,918
What her head would look like on a stick.

707
00:47:20,756 --> 00:47:24,218
Hi, guys.
I want to get your opinion on something.

708
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,888
It's my business card.

709
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,098
I decided to get a new one, too.

710
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:34,770
Oh, that's...

711
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,813
Very nice, Luis.

712
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:40,067
Thank you.

713
00:47:54,164 --> 00:47:55,332
Listen, what about dinner?

714
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:59,211
Is that all you ever have to contribute?
"What about fucking dinner?"

715
00:47:59,294 --> 00:48:02,130
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter,
no shiatsu this morning?

716
00:48:02,214 --> 00:48:04,007
Keep touching me like that,
and you'll draw back a stump.

717
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:06,468
- Hold on there, little buddy.
- Excuse me.

718
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:48,135
God. Patrick. Why here?

719
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,929
I've seen you looking at me.

720
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:54,933
I've noticed your hot body.

721
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:58,729
Don't be shy.

722
00:48:58,812 --> 00:49:00,939
You can't imagine
how long I've wanted this,

723
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,567
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

724
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:07,112
You were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

725
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,242
I want you.

726
00:49:12,743 --> 00:49:14,953
I want you, too.

727
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,872
- Patrick.
- What is it?

728
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:19,916
Where are you going?

729
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,128
I've gotta return some videotapes.

730
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:58,497
Okay, Monday? The 20th.

731
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,165
Monday? That's...

732
00:50:00,248 --> 00:50:03,001
- Any Paul Allen?
- Reservation, no. No reservation, but...

733
00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:05,128
Kimball. I've been wanting to talk with you.

734
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:08,340
Come into my office.
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

735
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:12,177
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance,

736
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,346
which was on the 20th of December?

737
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:16,348
God.

738
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:19,393
I guess I was probably
returning videotapes.

739
00:50:22,938 --> 00:50:25,023
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

740
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,484
- That's not what I've got.
- What?

741
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:30,696
That's not the information I've received.

742
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:33,699
Well, wait.
What information have you received?

743
00:50:33,782 --> 00:50:36,118
Let me see.

744
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,415
- You were with...
- Well, I could be wrong.

745
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:43,750
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

746
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:47,796
We'd gone to a new musical called...

747
00:50:48,004 --> 00:50:52,718
O Africa, Brave Africa.
It was a laugh riot. That was about it.

748
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,720
I think we had dinner at Orso's.

749
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,722
No, Petal... No, Orso's.

750
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,850
I hope I've been informative.
Long day. Bit scattered.

751
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,060
I'm a little spent now, too.

752
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:05,564
But how about lunch in a week or so,

753
00:51:05,647 --> 00:51:07,524
when I've sorted out all this information?

754
00:51:07,607 --> 00:51:08,900
Great. Yes, I'd like that.

755
00:51:08,984 --> 00:51:12,738
And if you could try and pin down
where you were

756
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:14,740
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,

757
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,241
it would make my job a lot easier.

758
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,702
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

759
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,041
Huey Lewis and the News.

760
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:30,505
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it?

761
00:51:31,673 --> 00:51:33,049
Never.

762
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:35,510
I mean, I don't really like singers.

763
00:51:35,594 --> 00:51:39,097
- Not a big music fan, huh?
- No, I like music.

764
00:51:39,181 --> 00:51:43,727
Just they're...
Huey's too black-sounding for me.

765
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:45,812
To each his own.

766
00:51:47,856 --> 00:51:50,484
So, lunch next week?

767
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,569
I'll be there.

768
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:30,232
Will you call me before Easter?

769
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:31,691
Maybe.

770
00:52:35,946 --> 00:52:37,447
What are you doing tonight?

771
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:41,535
Dinner at River Café.
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

772
00:52:41,618 --> 00:52:43,370
That's nice.

773
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,123
I never knew you smoked.

774
00:52:48,083 --> 00:52:50,085
You never noticed.

775
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:55,674
Listen, Patrick,

776
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,635
can we talk?

777
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:06,434
You look marvellous.

778
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:11,773
There's nothing to say.
You're gonna marry Luis.

779
00:53:11,857 --> 00:53:13,775
Isn't that special?

780
00:53:15,652 --> 00:53:16,987
Patrick?

781
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,618
Yes, Courtney?

782
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:30,709
If I don't see you before Easter,
have a nice one, okay?

783
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:38,008
You, too.

784
00:53:44,598 --> 00:53:46,057
Patrick?

785
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,226
Yeah?

786
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,937
Nothing.

787
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:24,095
There's this theory now that
if you can catch the AIDS virus

788
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:27,599
through having sex with someone,
then you can catch anything.

789
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:31,770
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
haemophilia, leukaemia,

790
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,563
diabetes, dyslexia.

791
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:36,316
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia's a virus.

792
00:54:37,108 --> 00:54:39,110
Who knows? They don't know that.

793
00:54:39,194 --> 00:54:40,528
Prove it.

794
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,459
- Oh, God!
- What?

795
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,503
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.

796
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:57,921
I wanna get high off this,

797
00:54:58,004 --> 00:54:59,756
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.

798
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,926
It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.

799
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:06,304
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs!

800
00:55:06,388 --> 00:55:09,516
- Fuck you!
- Calm down. Do it anyway.

801
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,311
That's right. That is, if the faggot
in the next stall thinks it's okay!

802
00:55:13,395 --> 00:55:14,896
- FUCK you!
'Hey, fuck you!

803
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:19,234
Sorry, dude. The steroids.

804
00:55:20,235 --> 00:55:22,195
Okay, let's do it.

805
00:55:43,216 --> 00:55:44,634
Where did Craig go?

806
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:47,137
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.

807
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,764
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty
between the United States and Russia.

808
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:52,434
He's the one behind Glasnost.

809
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:55,103
He said he was in mergers
and acquisitions.

810
00:55:55,186 --> 00:55:57,272
You're not confused, are you?

811
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,940
No, not really.

812
00:55:59,024 --> 00:56:01,026
Gorbachev is not downstairs.

813
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:04,654
Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

814
00:56:04,738 --> 00:56:06,740
Ask me a question.

815
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:09,617
So, what do you do?

816
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:13,496
I'm into murders and executions, mostly.

817
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:17,208
- Do you like it?
- Well, it depends. Why?

818
00:56:17,292 --> 00:56:18,918
Well, most guys I know

819
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:22,630
who work in mergers and acquisitions
really don't like it.

820
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:28,595
So, where do you work out?

821
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,476
- You think I'm dumb, don't you?
- What?

822
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,145
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

823
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:39,898
No. I really don't.

824
00:56:39,981 --> 00:56:42,901
That's okay. I don't mind.

825
00:56:42,984 --> 00:56:44,903
There's something sweet about you.

826
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:13,723
Doing the crossword?

827
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:20,355
You need any help?

828
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,158
Jean?

829
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:33,993
Yes, Patrick?

830
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:36,663
Would you like to
accompany me to dinner?

831
00:57:36,746 --> 00:57:40,041
That is, if you're not doing anything.

832
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:43,837
No. No, I don't have any plans.

833
00:57:44,879 --> 00:57:46,756
Well.

834
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:50,844
Isn't this a coincidence?

835
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:53,847
- Listen, where should we go?
- Anywhere you want.

836
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:56,933
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want?

837
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:01,146
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

838
00:58:01,229 --> 00:58:03,189
Come on.

839
00:58:03,273 --> 00:58:06,109
Where do you want to go?
Anywhere you want.

840
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:09,195
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

841
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,739
What about...

842
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:22,917
Dorsia?

843
00:58:28,214 --> 00:58:29,549
So,

844
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:33,178
Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.

845
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:37,140
I don't know.
No, we'll go wherever you want to go.

846
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,100
Dorsia is fine.

847
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:47,317
<i>Dorsia. Yes?</i>

848
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,320
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, well, let's say 9:00?

849
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:53,323
- We 're <i>totally</i> booked.
- Really? That's great.

850
00:58:53,406 --> 00:58:57,035
<i>- No, I said we are totally booked.
- Two at 9:00? Perfect.</i>

851
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:58,828
See you then.

852
00:59:02,123 --> 00:59:04,083
Yeah.

853
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,335
You're

854
00:59:06,753 --> 00:59:08,254
dressed okay.

855
00:59:09,214 --> 00:59:10,715
You didn't give a name.

856
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:12,300
They know me.

857
00:59:13,259 --> 00:59:18,264
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00, for drinks.

858
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:21,142
And, Jean?

859
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:23,561
You'll want to change before we go out.

860
00:59:32,278 --> 00:59:34,155
Patrick, it's so elegant.

861
00:59:34,656 --> 00:59:36,199
What a wonderful view.

862
00:59:36,491 --> 00:59:37,825
Jean?

863
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:40,370
Sorbet?

864
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:44,499
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

865
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:52,131
Do you want a bite?

866
00:59:52,215 --> 00:59:54,259
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

867
00:59:54,342 --> 00:59:57,929
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?

868
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:00,223
You look great. Very fit.

869
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:04,602
You can always be thinner, look better.

870
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:07,230
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.

871
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,190
I don't want to ruin your willpower.

872
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:11,776
No, it's all right.

873
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,862
I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

874
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:19,534
So, listen,

875
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,870
what do you really want
to do with your life?

876
01:00:23,162 --> 01:00:24,664
Just briefly. Summarise.

877
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:27,959
And don't tell me you enjoy
working with children, okay?

878
01:00:28,334 --> 01:00:31,254
Well, I'd like to travel

879
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:35,675
and maybe go back to school,
but I don't really know.

880
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:40,513
I'm at a point in my life where there
seems to be so many possibilities.

881
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,516
But I don't know. I'm just so unsure.

882
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:49,522
Do you have a boyfriend?

883
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:52,025
No, not really.

884
01:00:52,108 --> 01:00:53,735
Interesting.

885
01:00:53,818 --> 01:00:57,488
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

886
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,824
Maybe.

887
01:00:59,907 --> 01:01:01,617
I don't know.

888
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:03,453
Not really.

889
01:01:06,289 --> 01:01:07,332
Jean,

890
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,793
do you feel fulfilled?

891
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:13,671
I mean, in your life?

892
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:17,342
I guess I do. For a long time,
I was too focused on my work.

893
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:20,720
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself.

894
01:01:20,803 --> 01:01:24,682
You know, developing and growing.

895
01:01:24,766 --> 01:01:26,351
Growing.

896
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:28,436
I'm glad you said that.

897
01:01:31,773 --> 01:01:35,151
Did you know that Ted Bundy's
first dog, a collie,

898
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:37,695
was named Lassie?

899
01:01:37,779 --> 01:01:41,282
- Had you heard this?
- Who's Ted Bundy?

900
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:45,453
Forget it.

901
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:53,544
- What's that?
- Duct tape. I need it for taping something.

902
01:01:58,383 --> 01:01:59,842
Patrick?

903
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:04,389
Have you ever wanted to
make someone happy?

904
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:07,058
What? No! Put it in the carton!

905
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:09,977
Sorry.

906
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:13,314
Jean?

907
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,234
What?

908
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:20,530
Make someone happy.

909
01:02:20,613 --> 01:02:22,615
Have you ever wanted to?

910
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:27,662
I'm looking for...

911
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:34,752
I guess you could say I just want
to have a meaningful relationship

912
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:37,171
with someone special.

913
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:49,767
<i>Pa trick. Pa trick. I know you're there</i>

914
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:52,019
<i>Pick up the phone, you bad boy.</i>

915
01:02:52,103 --> 01:02:56,357
<i>What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.</i>

916
01:02:56,441 --> 01:02:58,443
<i>I hope you're not out
with some little number you picked up,</i>

917
01:02:58,526 --> 01:03:00,570
<i>because you're mine, Mr Bateman.</i>

918
01:03:00,653 --> 01:03:03,364
<i>My boy next door.</i>

919
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:05,825
<i>Anyway, you never called me,
and you said you would.</i>

920
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:08,369
<i>And I'll leave a message
for Jean about this, too, to remind you,</i>

921
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:10,830
<i>but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.</i>

922
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:13,166
<i>You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.</i>

923
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:15,293
<i>And we 're meeting at the Cornell Club,</i>

924
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:17,462
<i>so I'll call you tomorrow morning, honey.</i>

925
01:03:17,545 --> 01:03:20,089
<i>Oh. Sorry. I know you hate that.</i>

926
01:03:20,173 --> 01:03:23,468
<i>Bye, Patrick. Bye, Mr Big-time CEO.</i>

927
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:25,636
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

928
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:30,975
Was that Evelyn?

929
01:03:34,896 --> 01:03:37,231
Are you still seeing her?

930
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,614
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that.

931
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,078
Do you want me to go?

932
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:53,581
Yeah.

933
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,753
I don't think I can control myself.

934
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:02,340
I know. I should go.

935
01:04:02,423 --> 01:04:06,093
I know I have a tendency to
get involved with unavailable men.

936
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:10,097
I mean,

937
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:13,476
do you want me to go?

938
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:17,271
I think if you stay,

939
01:04:17,355 --> 01:04:19,524
something bad will happen.

940
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:23,569
I think I might hurt you.

941
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:26,864
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

942
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:29,116
No. No, I guess not

943
01:04:30,826 --> 01:04:33,162
I don't want to get bruised.

944
01:04:35,498 --> 01:04:38,459
You're right. I should go.

945
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:46,717
Oh. Don't forget you have
a lunch date tomorrow

946
01:04:46,801 --> 01:04:49,178
with Donald Kimball
at Smith and Wollensky.

947
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:51,639
Thanks.

948
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:54,642
It slipped my mind completely.

949
01:05:13,828 --> 01:05:15,204
So,

950
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:17,873
the night he disappeared,

951
01:05:17,957 --> 01:05:20,918
any new thoughts about what you did?

952
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:25,590
Not sure. I had a shower

953
01:05:27,216 --> 01:05:28,426
and some sorbet.

954
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,261
I think you're getting your dates mixed up.

955
01:05:30,344 --> 01:05:35,558
Well, where do you place Paul that night?

956
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:38,936
According to his date book,
and this was verified by his secretary,

957
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:42,106
he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram.

958
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,025
- And?
- I questioned him.

959
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,736
- Marcus.
- Yes, and he denies it.

960
01:05:46,819 --> 01:05:49,196
Though, at first, he couldn't be sure.

961
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,782
- But he denied it?
- Yes.

962
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:56,954
- Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
- Yes.

963
01:05:57,038 --> 01:06:00,374
- He does? You're sure?
- I've checked it out. It's clean.

964
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,715
Now, where were you?

965
01:06:09,175 --> 01:06:10,635
Where was Marcus?

966
01:06:10,718 --> 01:06:12,470
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

967
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:13,888
Who was he with?

968
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:16,432
He was at Atlantis

969
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:19,518
with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,

970
01:06:19,602 --> 01:06:21,312
Harry Newman, George Butner,

971
01:06:21,395 --> 01:06:23,981
and you.

972
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:30,404
Oh, right, yeah. Of course.

973
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:33,574
He had wanted Paul Allen to come,

974
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,494
but he had made plans,

975
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:40,539
and I guess I had dinner
with Victoria the following night.

976
01:06:40,623 --> 01:06:43,250
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso,

977
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:44,377
split town for a while.

978
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:47,546
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

979
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:50,424
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.

980
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:53,844
I mean, to think that one
of his friends killed him

981
01:06:53,928 --> 01:06:57,515
for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

982
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:00,059
Isn't that right, Patrick?

983
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,290
Christie. Christie!

984
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:27,211
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

985
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,880
This won't be anything like last time.
I promise.

986
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:32,842
I don't think so.

987
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:35,928
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

988
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:38,472
The driver's here. You're safe.

989
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:59,368
Nothing like last time. I promise.

990
01:07:59,452 --> 01:08:01,370
All right.

991
01:08:01,454 --> 01:08:04,749
So, you're looking great. How've you been?

992
01:08:04,832 --> 01:08:07,835
Well, I actually might need
a little surgery after last time.

993
01:08:07,918 --> 01:08:11,672
- Really?
- My friend told me I should get a lawyer.

994
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:15,760
Lawyers are so complicated.

995
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:17,344
Don't do that.

996
01:08:18,387 --> 01:08:20,055
Here's a cheque.

997
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:12,066
Half now, half later.

998
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:20,658
Okay. Your name's Christie.

999
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:23,452
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.

1000
01:09:23,536 --> 01:09:27,998
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.

1001
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:31,377
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.

1002
01:09:38,092 --> 01:09:41,095
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?

1003
01:09:43,264 --> 01:09:46,183
I think I met you at the Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?

1004
01:09:46,267 --> 01:09:49,562
Maybe not with Spicey, but definitely
at Surf Bar. You know, Surf Bar?

1005
01:09:49,645 --> 01:09:51,814
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.

1006
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:55,943
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

1007
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:59,697
This is nicer than your other apartment.

1008
01:10:01,949 --> 01:10:04,034
Well, it's not that nice.

1009
01:10:08,622 --> 01:10:10,207
Where did you two meet?

1010
01:10:10,291 --> 01:10:12,835
Oh, God. We met at...

1011
01:10:12,918 --> 01:10:16,881
Oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85 or '86.

1012
01:10:16,964 --> 01:10:19,258
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.

1013
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:22,553
- Hot number.
- What do you mean? She was a hot number.

1014
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:24,555
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blowjob.

1015
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:27,308
This girl worked at a tanning salon.
Need I say more?

1016
01:10:27,683 --> 01:10:29,560
What do you do?

1017
01:10:29,977 --> 01:10:32,229
She's my

1018
01:10:32,313 --> 01:10:33,981
cousin.

1019
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:37,026
She's from

1020
01:10:37,109 --> 01:10:38,110
France.

1021
01:10:38,861 --> 01:10:41,488
Where's your phone? I've gotta call Harley.

1022
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:48,746
Where do you summer? Southampton?

1023
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:50,748
No.

1024
01:10:50,831 --> 01:10:54,501
- Oh, God. It's his machine.
- Elizabeth, it's 3.00 in the morning.

1025
01:10:54,585 --> 01:10:57,087
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

1026
01:10:57,171 --> 01:10:59,548
- Don't tell him you're here.
- Why would I?

1027
01:10:59,632 --> 01:11:01,008
This tastes weird.

1028
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:03,093
Harley, it's me. I need your services.

1029
01:11:03,177 --> 01:11:05,429
Translate that however you want.

1030
01:11:05,512 --> 01:11:07,348
I'm at...

1031
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,601
- You're at Paul Allen's.
- Who?

1032
01:11:10,684 --> 01:11:13,187
- Paul Allen.
- I want the number, idiot.

1033
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,564
Anyway, I'm at Paul Normand's,
and I'll try you again later.

1034
01:11:15,648 --> 01:11:19,610
If I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night, I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

1035
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:23,322
Did you know that guy who disappeared?
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce?

1036
01:11:23,405 --> 01:11:26,283
- Was he a friend of yours?
- No.

1037
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:28,994
Do you have any coke? Or Halcion?

1038
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:30,955
Oh, I would take a Halcion.

1039
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:32,706
Listen.

1040
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,126
I would just like to see

1041
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:38,754
the two of you get it on.

1042
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:42,299
What's wrong with that?

1043
01:11:42,383 --> 01:11:43,968
It's totally disease-free.

1044
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,181
- Patrick, you're a lunatic.
- Come on.

1045
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,600
Don't you find Christie attractive?

1046
01:11:51,684 --> 01:11:55,437
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.

1047
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,940
Come on.

1048
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:00,109
I think it'd be a turn-on.

1049
01:12:00,192 --> 01:12:01,777
Does he do this all the time?

1050
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:07,199
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

1051
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:11,078
You're telling me
you've never gotten it on with a girl?

1052
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:13,998
No. I'm not a lesbian.

1053
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:17,167
Why would you think I would be into that?

1054
01:12:17,251 --> 01:12:19,044
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence,
for one thing.

1055
01:12:19,128 --> 01:12:21,964
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.

1056
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:24,341
You're making me feel weird.

1057
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,347
Did you know

1058
01:12:30,973 --> 01:12:33,934
that Whitney Houston's debut LP,

1059
01:12:34,018 --> 01:12:37,229
<i>called simply Whitney Houston,</i>

1060
01:12:37,312 --> 01:12:40,232
had four number-one singles on it?

1061
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:43,527
Did you know that, Christie?

1062
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,697
You actually listen to Whitney Houston?

1063
01:12:47,156 --> 01:12:50,117
You own a Whitney Houston CD?

1064
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,870
More than one?

1065
01:12:54,621 --> 01:12:57,499
It's hard to choose a favourite
among so many great tracks,

1066
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:02,463
<i>but The Greatest Love of All</i>

1067
01:13:02,546 --> 01:13:07,342
is one of the best,
most powerful songs ever written

1068
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:11,346
about self-preservation, dignity.

1069
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:15,225
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries

1070
01:13:15,309 --> 01:13:18,979
and instils one with the hope

1071
01:13:19,063 --> 01:13:22,566
that it's not too late to better ourselves.

1072
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:26,820
Since, Elizabeth,

1073
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:30,282
it's impossible in this world we live in

1074
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:32,451
to empathize with others,

1075
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:35,287
we can always empathize with ourselves.

1076
01:13:35,746 --> 01:13:37,623
It's an important message.

1077
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:40,125
Crucial, really.

1078
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:45,672
And it's beautifully stated on the album.

1079
01:14:56,827 --> 01:14:58,537
Not the face, you bitch!

1080
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:02,166
Not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!

1081
01:16:30,879 --> 01:16:33,590
I want a firm commitment.

1082
01:16:33,674 --> 01:16:35,425
I think, Evelyn,

1083
01:16:35,509 --> 01:16:37,761
that we've lost touch.

1084
01:16:37,844 --> 01:16:39,513
Why? What's wrong?

1085
01:16:42,683 --> 01:16:44,601
My need to engage in homicidal behaviour

1086
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:47,479
on a massive scale cannot be corrected,

1087
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:50,524
but I have no other way to fulfil my needs.

1088
01:16:52,276 --> 01:16:55,070
- We need to talk.
- Talk about what, Patrick?

1089
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,239
It's over, Evelyn.

1090
01:16:57,322 --> 01:16:59,950
It's all over.

1091
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:03,120
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

1092
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:07,124
Let's just avoid the issue, all right?
Now, are we having coffee?

1093
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:09,626
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us.

1094
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:13,255
This is no joke.

1095
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:15,299
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

1096
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:19,594
But your friends are my friends,
and my friends are your friends.

1097
01:17:20,178 --> 01:17:23,390
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something...

1098
01:17:23,473 --> 01:17:26,184
I know that your friends are my friends,

1099
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:28,562
and I've thought about that.

1100
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:31,398
You can have them.

1101
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:35,068
- You're really serious, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

1102
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:41,408
What about the past? Our past?

1103
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,410
We never really shared one.

1104
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:44,995
- You're inhuman.
- No.

1105
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:46,955
I'm in touch with humanity.

1106
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:50,000
Evelyn, I'm sorry.

1107
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,418
I just...

1108
01:17:53,128 --> 01:17:55,339
You're not terribly important to me.

1109
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:57,090
Oh, no!

1110
01:17:57,466 --> 01:17:59,593
No! No!

1111
01:18:00,427 --> 01:18:05,015
I know my behaviour
can be erratic sometimes.

1112
01:18:05,807 --> 01:18:09,227
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?

1113
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:12,481
If you really want to do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

1114
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:15,817
- Oh, God, I can't believe this.
- I'm leaving.

1115
01:18:15,901 --> 01:18:18,653
I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.

1116
01:18:18,737 --> 01:18:21,031
- Where are you going?
- Just leaving.

1117
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:22,866
But where?

1118
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:26,787
I have to return some videotapes.

1119
01:18:57,484 --> 01:18:59,486
Here, kitty, kitty.

1120
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:18,213
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

1121
01:19:18,296 --> 01:19:19,589
Stop that.

1122
01:20:01,882 --> 01:20:04,009
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

1123
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:06,219
Get on the ground! Put...

1124
01:20:49,262 --> 01:20:51,681
Burning the midnight oil, Mr Smith?

1125
01:20:51,765 --> 01:20:54,434
Hey, now don't forget to sign in.

1126
01:21:34,474 --> 01:21:36,017
Hi.

1127
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:27,152
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman.

1128
01:22:27,235 --> 01:22:29,946
You're my lawyer, so I think
you should know, I've killed a lot of people.

1129
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:32,574
Some escort girls in an apartment uptown,

1130
01:22:34,326 --> 01:22:36,411
some homeless people, maybe five or ten,

1131
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:38,204
an NYU girl I met in Central Park,

1132
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:40,457
I left her in a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

1133
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:43,835
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend, with a nail gun,

1134
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:48,131
and some man...
Some old faggot with a dog.

1135
01:22:48,214 --> 01:22:52,302
Last week, I... I killed another girl

1136
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:54,387
with a chain saw.

1137
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:59,934
I had to. She almost got away.

1138
01:23:02,354 --> 01:23:04,189
Someone else there. I can't remember.

1139
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:07,525
Maybe a model. But she's dead, too.

1140
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:10,111
And Paul Allen.

1141
01:23:10,195 --> 01:23:13,948
I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face.

1142
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:18,078
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

1143
01:23:18,536 --> 01:23:20,288
I don't want to leave anything out here.

1144
01:23:20,372 --> 01:23:23,166
I guess I've killed maybe 20 people,

1145
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:25,251
maybe 40.

1146
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:29,839
I have tapes of a lot of it.

1147
01:23:29,923 --> 01:23:32,425
Some of the girls have seen the tapes.

1148
01:23:32,509 --> 01:23:34,427
I even...

1149
01:23:42,268 --> 01:23:44,479
I ate some of their brains.

1150
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,274
And I tried to cook a little.

1151
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:52,612
Tonight, I...

1152
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:59,411
I just had to kill a lot of people, and...

1153
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:08,545
I'm not sure
I'm gonna get away with it this time.

1154
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:14,509
So, I mean...

1155
01:24:16,219 --> 01:24:18,179
I guess

1156
01:24:18,263 --> 01:24:20,014
I'm a pretty...

1157
01:24:21,891 --> 01:24:24,477
I mean, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.

1158
01:24:26,563 --> 01:24:29,065
So,

1159
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:31,317
if you get back tomorrow,

1160
01:24:32,318 --> 01:24:34,404
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

1161
01:24:34,487 --> 01:24:36,197
So, you know.

1162
01:24:37,574 --> 01:24:39,868
Keep your eyes open.

1163
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:01,634
Are you my 2:00?

1164
01:27:01,718 --> 01:27:02,927
No.

1165
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:06,723
Can I help you?

1166
01:27:06,806 --> 01:27:11,060
I'm looking for Paul Allen's place.

1167
01:27:11,728 --> 01:27:14,188
Doesn't he live here?

1168
01:27:14,272 --> 01:27:16,065
No, he doesn't.

1169
01:27:16,357 --> 01:27:18,985
You sure?

1170
01:27:19,068 --> 01:27:21,112
You saw the ad in the Times?

1171
01:27:21,195 --> 01:27:24,407
No. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

1172
01:27:25,283 --> 01:27:28,786
<i>- In the Times.
- There was no ad in the Times.</i>

1173
01:27:29,245 --> 01:27:31,414
I think you should go now.

1174
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,166
But I think...

1175
01:27:35,752 --> 01:27:37,378
I want to know what happened here.

1176
01:27:37,462 --> 01:27:40,423
Don't make any trouble, please.

1177
01:27:40,506 --> 01:27:42,508
I suggest you 9°-

1178
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:56,814
Don't come back.

1179
01:27:56,898 --> 01:27:59,067
I won't.

1180
01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:00,818
Don't worry.

1181
01:28:31,307 --> 01:28:32,350
Patrick Bateman's office.

1182
01:28:32,433 --> 01:28:36,104
- Jean? I need help.
- Patrick, is that you?

1183
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,815
Jean, I'm not...

1184
01:28:40,024 --> 01:28:41,859
Craig McDermott called.
He wants to meet you,

1185
01:28:41,943 --> 01:28:44,278
David Van Patten, and Tim Bryce
at Harry's for drinks.

1186
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:45,947
Oh, God.

1187
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:48,700
What did you say, you dumb bitch?

1188
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:52,412
<i>- Patrick, I can't hear you.
- What am I doing?</i>

1189
01:28:52,495 --> 01:28:54,497
Where are you, Patrick? What's wrong?

1190
01:28:56,374 --> 01:29:00,211
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean,

1191
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:03,006
to the office this afternoon.

1192
01:29:03,089 --> 01:29:05,049
VVhy?

1193
01:29:05,133 --> 01:29:07,468
<i>Just say no!</i>

1194
01:29:08,553 --> 01:29:10,096
What is it, Patrick? Are you all right?

1195
01:29:10,805 --> 01:29:14,726
Stop sounding so fucking sad!

1196
01:29:14,809 --> 01:29:16,102
<i>Jesus!</i>

1197
01:30:33,513 --> 01:30:34,555
Table for three.

1198
01:30:34,639 --> 01:30:37,934
Bateman, you look a little wild-eyed.
Rough day at the office?

1199
01:30:38,017 --> 01:30:40,478
Look, Bryce is back,
and he's drinking mineral water.

1200
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:44,690
He's a changed man, except he still
can't get a reservation to save his life.

1201
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:46,776
Why don't you just try 150 Wooster?

1202
01:30:46,859 --> 01:30:49,779
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

1203
01:30:49,862 --> 01:30:52,615
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar.

1204
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:54,283
Come on, faggots, let's get a res.

1205
01:30:54,367 --> 01:30:57,120
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

1206
01:30:58,121 --> 01:30:59,622
Need a reservation for 8:30.

1207
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:02,542
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.

1208
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:04,877
10:00 would not be any good, no.

1209
01:31:04,961 --> 01:31:06,337
Just fucking call them.

1210
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,047
- Give me the phone. I'll do it.
- I'll call you back.

1211
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:11,968
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

1212
01:31:12,051 --> 01:31:14,720
Shut up, Carnes. They will not.

1213
01:31:16,264 --> 01:31:20,059
So, Harold, did you get my message?

1214
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,937
Jesus, yes! That was hilarious.

1215
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:25,189
- That was you, wasn't it?
- Yeah, naturally.

1216
01:31:25,273 --> 01:31:28,067
Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls.
That's fabulous.

1217
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:30,194
- That's rich.
- What exactly do you mean?

1218
01:31:30,278 --> 01:31:33,156
The message you left.
By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?

1219
01:31:33,239 --> 01:31:36,909
- You're still seeing her, right?
- Wait, Harold. What do you mean?

1220
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:40,329
Excuse me. Nothing. It's good to see you.

1221
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:42,123
Is that Edward Towers?

1222
01:31:43,332 --> 01:31:44,792
Wait.

1223
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:46,544
Davis.

1224
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:49,505
I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.

1225
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:52,133
Your joke was amusing, but come on, man.

1226
01:31:52,216 --> 01:31:54,677
You had one fatal flaw.

1227
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:57,013
Bateman is such a dork.

1228
01:31:57,597 --> 01:32:00,683
Such a boring, spineless lightweight.

1229
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:04,770
Now if you said Bryce or McDermott...
Otherwise, it was amusing.

1230
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:07,356
Now if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

1231
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:08,774
Wait.

1232
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:12,195
Stop.

1233
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:14,197
I did it, Carnes.

1234
01:32:15,323 --> 01:32:16,866
I killed him.

1235
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:19,702
I'm Patrick Bateman.

1236
01:32:22,622 --> 01:32:24,957
I chopped Allen's fucking head off.

1237
01:32:26,209 --> 01:32:31,130
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

1238
01:32:31,464 --> 01:32:34,133
Excuse me. I really must be going now.

1239
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,261
No, listen.

1240
01:32:37,345 --> 01:32:39,972
Don't you know who I am?

1241
01:32:40,056 --> 01:32:42,850
I'm not Davis. I'm Patrick Bateman.

1242
01:32:45,645 --> 01:32:48,814
We talk on the phone all the time.

1243
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:50,816
Don't you recognise me?

1244
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:54,654
You're my lawyer.

1245
01:32:56,322 --> 01:32:58,574
Now, Carnes,

1246
01:32:58,658 --> 01:33:00,201
listen.

1247
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:02,495
Listen very, very carefully.

1248
01:33:06,374 --> 01:33:08,292
I killed Paul Allen,

1249
01:33:10,294 --> 01:33:11,796
and I liked it.

1250
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:15,716
I can't make myself any clearer.

1251
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:18,177
But that's simply not possible.

1252
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:19,804
And I don't find this funny any more.

1253
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:22,181
It never was supposed to be.

1254
01:33:22,265 --> 01:33:24,308
- Why isn't it possible?
- It's just not.

1255
01:33:24,392 --> 01:33:27,853
Why not, you stupid bastard?

1256
01:33:28,354 --> 01:33:32,942
Because I had dinner with Paul Allen
twice in London, just 10 days ago.

1257
01:33:33,025 --> 01:33:35,027
No, you...

1258
01:33:37,697 --> 01:33:38,739
Didn't.

1259
01:33:38,823 --> 01:33:40,825
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1260
01:34:21,699 --> 01:34:23,868
<i>We've seen the results of that mistrust</i>

1261
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:27,580
<i>in the form of lies, divisions, and mistakes.</i>

1262
01:34:27,663 --> 01:34:29,665
<i>We need to find a way to cooperate</i>

1263
01:34:29,749 --> 01:34:32,001
<i>while realising foreign policy</i>

1264
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:34,670
<i>can't be run by committee.</i>

1265
01:34:34,754 --> 01:34:37,298
<i>And I believe there's now
the growing sense</i>

1266
01:34:37,381 --> 01:34:41,052
<i>that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.</i>

1267
01:34:41,135 --> 01:34:45,514
<i>And, in the end, this may be
the eventual blessing in disguise</i>

1268
01:34:45,598 --> 01:34:47,350
<i>to come out of the Iran-Contra mess</i>

1269
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:49,602
How can he lie like that?

1270
01:34:51,187 --> 01:34:53,147
- How can he pull that shit?
- What shit?

1271
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:55,691
Now where do we have reservations at?

1272
01:34:55,775 --> 01:34:58,194
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

1273
01:34:58,277 --> 01:35:01,197
How can you be so fucking...

1274
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,866
I don't know... Cool about it?

1275
01:35:03,949 --> 01:35:06,535
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

1276
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:13,250
Bateman?

1277
01:35:14,502 --> 01:35:16,379
What are you so fucking zany about?

1278
01:35:16,462 --> 01:35:19,298
I'm just a happy camper.

1279
01:35:19,382 --> 01:35:21,050
Rockin' and a-rollin'!

1280
01:35:22,885 --> 01:35:24,470
Oh, brother! Look.

1281
01:35:24,553 --> 01:35:27,390
He presents himself
as this harmless old codger,

1282
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,725
but inside...

1283
01:35:29,809 --> 01:35:31,602
But inside...

1284
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:34,313
<i>But inside doesn't matter.</i>

1285
01:35:35,314 --> 01:35:39,735
Inside? Yes? Inside? Believe it or not,
Bryce, we're actually listening to you.

1286
01:35:39,819 --> 01:35:42,446
Come on, Bateman, what do you think?

1287
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:46,492
Whatever.

1288
01:35:46,575 --> 01:35:49,036
Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

1289
01:35:49,995 --> 01:35:51,664
I need a scotch.

1290
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:55,626
<i>When I named him to
the U. S. Court of Appeals,</i>

1291
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:58,170
<i>the American Bar Association...</i>

1292
01:36:07,555 --> 01:36:10,599
<i>There are no more barriers to cross.</i>

1293
01:36:10,683 --> 01:36:13,185
<i>All I have in common
with the uncontrollable</i>

1294
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:16,272
<i>and the insane, the vicious and the evil,</i>

1295
01:36:16,355 --> 01:36:20,109
<i>all the mayhem I have caused
and my utter indifference toward it,</i>

1296
01:36:20,192 --> 01:36:22,528
<i>I have now surpassed.</i>

1297
01:36:25,448 --> 01:36:28,284
<i>My pain is constant and sharp,</i>

1298
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:32,079
<i>and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.</i>

1299
01:36:32,163 --> 01:36:36,750
<i>In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.</i>

1300
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:39,044
<i>I want no one to escape.</i>

1301
01:36:41,213 --> 01:36:43,340
<i>But even after admitting this,</i>

1302
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,593
<i>there is no catharsis.</i>

1303
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:48,429
<i>My punishment continues to elude me,</i>

1304
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:51,765
<i>and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.</i>

1305
01:36:51,849 --> 01:36:55,644
<i>No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.</i>

1306
01:36:55,728 --> 01:36:59,857
<i>This confession has meant nothing.</i>
